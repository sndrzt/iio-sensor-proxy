2.4
---

This release fixes data being incorrectly read from sensors due to
a naively broken compilation fix. It also supports Geoclue running
as a different user than "geoclue".

2.3
---

This release fixes API documentation not being in the tarball,
removes a work-around for long-standing kernel bug (see README.md
for details), and ignores accelerometers that are part of gaming
devices. A number of build warnings were also fixed.

2.2
---

This release fixes iio-sensor-proxy not receiving udev events
because of the excessive lockdown added in version 2.1. This
also fixes a possible crash on startup due to a race condition.

2.1
---

This release fixes a security problem that will affect services
other than iio-sensor-proxy, that have a system D-Bus interface.
Upgrading to this version is highly recommended.

- Make D-Bus policy rules only affect SensorProxy itself
- Lockdown service through systemd
- Fix startup problem on machines with a Compass device

2.0
---

This release adds build fixes, fixes the detection of a number of
devices that should be supported, stops trying to use devices
that shouldn't, and adds support for the "mount-matrix" property,
which can be used to fix the orientation of accelerometers on
devices where the default does not work.

- Add support for ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX udev property
- Fix startup failure on certain devices
- Work-around possible kernel bug on certain devices
- Better supported/unsupported sensors detection
- Better debug output

1.3
---

This release adds build fixes, fixes accelerometer unit scaling and
really fixes regression with the IIO accelerometer in kernel 4.8 that
was supposed to be fixed in version 1.2.

1.2
---

This release mainly adds better debug output, and updated testing
instructions in the README.

- Fix regression with IIO accelerometer in kernel 4.8
- Fix possible crash in compass handling

1.1
---

This release adds support for Compasses (only accessible to GeoClue).

- Fix service not starting in a number of cases
- Fix excessive CPU usage monitoring light sensors on Macs
- Support light sensors on some Samsung laptops
- Fix incorrect sensor readings on some devices due to unit scaling

1.0
---

This is the first stable release of iio-sensor-proxy. It now uses a D-Bus API,
and supports accelerometers and ambient light sensors.

0.1
---

This is the first version of iio-sensor-proxy. It supports accelerometers,
proxying IIO sensors, and mimicking input device accelerometers.
